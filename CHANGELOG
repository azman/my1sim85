my1sim85-0.2.3
--------------

Update:
- n/a

Feature:
- n/a

Bugfix:
- [FIXED] arithmetic operation involving carry in (was always 1)

Issues:
- still missing high-resolution timer (but not so bad on win32?)
- on win32-virtualbox-guestOS, setting linebreaks are +1 (click 1, set 2)

--------------
my1sim85-0.2.2
--------------

Update:
- welcome page can no longer be closed
- added build mode button on toolbar/menu

Feature:
- n/a

Bugfix:
- [FIXED] get address dialog didn't return properly when cancelled
- [FIXED] proc toolbar got enabled after system build is done
- [FIXED] log panel was not disabled in build mode

Issues:
- still missing high-resolution timer (but not so bad on win32?)
- on win32-virtualbox-guestOS, setting linebreaks are +1 (click 1, set 2)

--------------
my1sim85-0.2.1
--------------

Update:
- breakpoint setting during simulation

Feature:
- n/a

Bugfix:
- [FIXED] halt instruction was not handled properly
- [FIXED] miniviewer not browsed during update
- [FIXED] win32: no newline char in compiler output
- [FIXED] breakpoint (mouseclick) - was written for vbox testing...

Issues:
- still missing high-resolution timer (but not so bad on win32?)

--------------
my1sim85-0.2.0
--------------

Update:
- mini memory viewer for simple memory transfer verification
- on Win32, assembler output is now on gui (using temp file)

Feature:
- can create multiple mini memory viewer

Bugfix:
- saving a newly opened file caused run-time assertion error (FIXED!)

Issues:
- still missing high-resolution timer (but not so bad on win32?)

--------------
my1sim85-0.1.2
--------------

Update:
- simple GUI for system build (build mode)

Feature:
- no new feature

Bugfix:
- code modification now checked before sim/hex

Issues:
- still missing high-resolution timer
- on Win32, assembler output is on console
  = mingw doesn't support open_memstream

--------------
my1sim85-0.1.1
--------------

Update:
- build is more dynamic (run-time build possible)
  = limited to the three memory/device type
  = GUI is not change-friendly!
- compiled using wxWidgets-2.9.x

Feature:
- more command available @ console prompt
- LED/switches can be re-linked to other pins!

Issues:
- still missing high-resolution timer

--------------
my1sim85-0.1.0
--------------

Update:
- basic simulation working for a first release

Features:
- basic system: 8085, 2764 ROM, 62664 RAM, 8255 PPI
- LED and switch IO devices
  = 8-LEDs & 8-Switches fixed to specific 8255 port/pin
- editor, assembler built-in
- machine cycle ratio is considered
  = running LED light simulator possible
- continous/step simulation mode
- ready for console-based control
  = change simulation start address already possible

Issues:
- something about wxrc when creating new file?
  = will check this later...
- timer not working very well
  = cannot get mm timer resolution
  = cannot get 325ns state period (6MHz crystal)
  = small variations may occur
  = changes in loop delay may not be noticable
  = on my laptop, it's horrible! (no delay needed for running light!)
- cannot be compiled on wxwidgets-2.8
  = wxstring object in wxwidgets-2.9 is different
