- basic system: 8085, 2764 ROM, 62664 RAM, 8255 PPI
- LED and switch IO devices
  = 8-LEDs & 8-Switches fixed to specific 8255 port/pin
- editor, assembler built-in
- machine cycle ratio is considered
  = running LED light simulator possible
- continous/step simulation mode
- ready for console-based control
  = change simulation start address already possible

Issues:
- something about wxrc when creating new file?
  = will check this later...
- timer not working very well
  = cannot get mm timer resolution
  = cannot get 325ns state period (6MHz crystal)
  = small variations may occur
  = changes in loop delay may not be noticable
  = on my laptop, it's horrible! (no delay needed for running light!)
- cannot be compiled on wxwidgets-2.8
  = wxstring object in wxwidgets-2.9 is different
