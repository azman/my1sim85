This is the ultimate development tool for 8085 Intel Microprocessor-based
systems. Mainly an 8085 system simulator, it uses my1asm85 cross assembler to
generate instruction bytes and my1termu terminal emulator for hardware
interface. The simple GUI module for my1termu is from the my1termw project.

This code is written for both Linux and Win32 (MinGW) platform.

Example assembly codes are available in the 'asm' folder.

Example system builds are available in the 'sys' folder.
